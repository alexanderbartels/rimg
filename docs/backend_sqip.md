## About

This Backend uses the [primitive tool](https://github.com/fogleman/primitive) through the [sqip](https://github.com/technopagan/sqip) npm module to process the images.

!> Note that you need the primitive binaries in your Path to use this backend. Because the primitive Binaries are not packaged with the binary installations. If you have installed `rimg`via npm everything should work without any extra work.  


## Supported Commands
* `sqip` - It uses the sqip npm module.
